## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in Chemistry at the University of Rochester. 
  As a member of Professor Kathryn E. Knowles' [research group](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/chm/groups/knowles/), 
  I design novel approaches towards the synthesis of ternary metal oxide semiconductor 
  nanocrystals and study their fundamental properties via various Spectroscopic (XPS, UV-Vis-NIR, EDXS), 
  Microscopic (TEM, SEM) and Diffraction (p-XRD, SC-XRD) techniques. 
  
  I enjoy seeing myself as a proactive leader and being able to contribute on both the individual and team levels. 
  I am passionate about volunteering time for the advancement of science in different social sectors. 
  I hope to continue to develop myself as a professional by gaining both the depth and breadth of a multi-talented scientist.
  
  Outside Chemistry I enjoy hiking, playing volleyball, dancing and discovering music.
