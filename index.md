## About Me

  I am a synthetic chemist, enthusiast of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, 
  with extensive experience in analytical techniques for inorganic physical chemistry and solid-state characterization. 
  My curiosity about the incredible opportunities and discoveries Nanoscience can bring to our ever-growing technologic era, 
  guided me to start my scientific career as a Molecular Designer and Nanochemist in 2014. I have continued on that path ever since. 
  I enjoy facing the challenges involved in designing novel multicomponent and advanced materials with potential applications 
  in environmental remediation and energy conversion. 
  At Professor Kathryn E. Knowles' [research group](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/chm/groups/knowles/), 
  I create and optimize synthetic approaches for complex metal oxide semiconductor nanocrystals and 
  study their fundamental properties via various Analytical and Spectroscopic (XPS, UV-Vis-NIR, EDXS, TEM, SEM, p-XRD, SC-XRD) techniques. 
  Currently, I explore spinel ferrite nanocrystals' performance as photocatalysts 
  for oxidative degradation of pollutants and chemical reduction into added-value compounds. 
  I hope my PhD outcomes have an impact on future water remediation technologies.

  My personal and professional experiences have helped me to quickly build a cross-cultural multi-disciplinary network
  as well as to broaden my perspective of the world. I enjoy seeing myself as a proactive leader and being able
  to contribute on both the individual and team levels. 
  I am passionate about volunteering time for the advancement of science. 
  I hope to continue to develop and educate myself as a civil person and professional by 
  gaining both the depth and breadth of a multi-talented scientist.
 
  Outside Chemistry I enjoy hiking, dancing and discovering foreign-language music.
