## Work Experience

**_Teaching Assistant_** - University of Rochester
**SEM Practicum** - Spring 2021
• Trained advanced undergraduate and graduate students on the practical aspects of performing SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and Scanning Probe (AFM, STM), and assisted them interpreting and analyzing the generated data.

**_Advanced Laboratory Techniques_** - Spring 2020
• Worked in a team of 8 people to organize the materials to train 7 advanced undergraduate students on the synthesis, characterization, and analysis applied to problems in inorganic and organic chemistry.

**_Chemical Concepts, Systems and Practices II_** - Spring 2019
• Trained 13 freshman students on the applications of chemical bonding, kinetics and thermodynamics.

 **_DAAD RISE Professional Intern_** - BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany
Project: "Physicochemical Characterizations of Multi-Component Materials"
• Measured the surface reactivity and dissolution kinetics of a family of multi-component materials, e.g., Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Quantum Dots, by employing the Continuous Flow System (CFS) and the Ferric Reducing Ability of Serum (FRAS) methodologies, respectively.
• Communicated with external partners who perform pairwise similarity calculations for nanomaterials grouping against biologically relevant reference materials.
• My team outcomes were contributed to case studies relevant for safe-by-design (SbD) and grouping strategies for nanomaterials, in large EU-wide projects, such as HARMLESS (Advanced High Aspect Ratio and Multicomponent materials: towards comprehensive intelLigent tEsting and Safe by design Strategies)
